# Public API Request - Unit 05

- Purpose of this project: 

  - This project is created for the purpose of JavaScript Full Stack TechDegree - Unit 05 with TeamTreehouse. 
  
  - The app will be deployed to GitHub pages: 
  https://developerjw.github.io/Public-API-Requests/
  
  
  
- Project Description:
  - For this project, you'll build an app for a fictional company called Awesome Startup, a distributed company with 
  remote employees working all over the world. They need a smart way for employees to share contact information with 
  each other.
  
  - The App will request a JSON object from the API and parse the data so that 12 employees are listed in a grid with their thumbnail image, full name, email, and location. 
  
  - This APP uses the Random User Generator API (https://randomuser.me/) to grab information for 12 random “employees,” and use 
  that data to build a prototype for an Awesome Startup employee directory.
  
  - FetchAPI is used for this project.
  
  
  

Extra Credit:
-
- Add Search Functionality

    Add a way to filter the directory by name. To do this, you’ll need to adjust your API request to retrieve a user nationality 
    that will only return data in the English alphabet.
    
- Modal toggle

    Add a way to toggle back and forth between employees when the modal window is open.
    
- Structure, style and CSS
    - in style.css: 
        - header header h1, added font-family: "Lucida Console", Monaco, monospace;
        - changed the font color when the previous or next button is disabled
        - added background image
